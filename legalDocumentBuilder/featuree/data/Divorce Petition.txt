relatives and friends. The life of petitioner became like a hell due to the respondent’s behaviour. 
5- That although the parents of the respondent arranged a very decent marriage according to his

respondent many times to change his behavior and not to drink but the respondent refused to 
accept the legitimate requests of the petitioner and the relatives. 
8- That the respondent has deserted the petitioner without any reasonable and justifiable cause and 
rhyme and hence it has become impossible for the petitioner to live more in the company of the
